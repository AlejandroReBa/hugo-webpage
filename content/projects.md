Some projects I maintain and/or created:

* [Cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra) - Apgar is a quick and dirty health-check driver written in Go to prevent dependency conflicts. It is explicitly designed to be simple and not interfere with anything else running on your servers.
* [Viper](https://github.com/spf13/viper)
* [J Walter Weatherman](https://github.com/spf13/jWalterWeatherman)
* [Cast](https://github.com/spf13/cast)
